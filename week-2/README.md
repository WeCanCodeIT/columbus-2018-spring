# Week 2

## Day 1

### Topics

- Project Reflections
- CodingBat Warmup 1 discussion/demo/practice
- Understanding when to use loops
- Understand why a loop would be needed
- `while` loops
- `do/while` loops
- infinite loops and the debugger
- branching statements: `break`, `continue`, and `return` (time permitting)

### Activities

- [While Loop practice problems](https://wecancodeit.github.io/java-exercises/fundamentals-practice-problems/while-loops/)
- Loops Part 1 Slide # 10
- With time left today, practice more loop scenarios or make a mini game with a looping effect
	- loop to play over and over again
	- use accumulator variables to keep track of points
	- use a random number generator
	- what types of games can we come up with?
- Recommended Reading: Head First Java pages 10-14, 23, 24
